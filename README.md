# Library-App

- This project is a Library Application that allows a User to make a quick Book search. The app uses the Google Books API to provide the:

    - Book Title
    - Book Author
    - Book Published Date
    - Book Description
    
as well as a Buy Link to Purchase the Book from Google Books. (The Link is only allowed to be clicked on if it is sold/available on Google Books. Otherwise, the Buy Link will not be clickable).

- The User uses the Search Bar to make Book searches, and the resuls will show up on the page.

- The User has the option to Add certain Books to the Saved Books Page.
    - (Could not get it to work. Could not figure out how to tranfer the results data to the Saved Books Page)
    - In the Saved Books Page, the User can further classify the Saved Books
        - Favorites
        - Done Reading
        - Books to Read
        - etc.
